        <h3>About me</h3>
        
        <p>I am a data journalist at <a href="http://www.thepennyhoarder.com">The Penny Hoarder</a>, where I scrape, clean, analyze and visualize data, among other things. Here are those other things:</p>
        <ul>
                <li>&#8226; Appear in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJTQWh4GObA">scripted videos</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&v=CZOukD9zwiE">perform voice-over work</a></li>
                <li>&#8226; Go on news stations as <a href="https://cheddar.com/videos/these-cities-are-getting-pricer-and-pricer">on-air talent</a></li>
                <li>&#8226; Teach data classes to colleagues</li>
              </ul> 
          <p>I've been sort of a Renaissance journalist over the years, during which I have taught myself to write scripts, shoot, light and edit video in Adobe Premiere, learned to code in Python and R and helped launch a content management system.<label for="observer website" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><span class="sidenote"><a href="https://www.yourobserver.com">Check it out here!</span></p>
